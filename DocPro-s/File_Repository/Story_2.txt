In the year 2147, Earth was dying. The oceans had risen, the atmosphere was thin, and most of humanity had abandoned the planet, scattering across the stars in search of new homes. The great exodus had left behind only the poor, the stubborn, and those with nowhere else to go.

Lena Marlowe was one of the stubborn ones. A communications officer for the New Dawn colony, her job was to monitor deep-space signals — a mostly meaningless task since no one had heard from the colonies beyond Proxima Centauri in over 50 years. Every day, she would sit in the small communications outpost, her only company a rusting AI named Echo, and listen to the static hum of the cosmos.

One evening, as Lena was about to shut down the console for the night, Echo’s voice chimed through the silence.
"Lena, you might want to hear this."

She leaned forward, brushing her short dark hair behind her ear. "Is it another pulse from Saturn?"

"No," Echo replied. "It’s coming from outside the system. Coordinates suggest… Andromeda."

Lena’s eyes narrowed. "That’s impossible. No human expedition ever made it that far."

The signal was faint — a repeating tone buried beneath layers of cosmic noise. But it was deliberate. Intelligent. She ran a decryption algorithm through the console. After a few moments, words began to emerge:

"HELP US."

Her breath hitched. "Echo… is this confirmed?"

"98.7% match to human communication patterns. And Lena…" Echo’s voice grew softer. "The encryption key matches the lost Prometheus expedition."

Lena’s heart raced. The Prometheus had been the first interstellar ship to leave the Milky Way over a century ago. Its disappearance had been a tragic mystery. No wreckage. No survivors. Just… gone.

She adjusted the receiver, trying to clean the signal. "Prometheus… this is Lena Marlowe of New Dawn colony. We hear you. Please respond."

Silence.

Then: "Lena?"

Her blood froze. It was a human voice. Weak and distorted, but unmistakably human.

"Prometheus… who is this?"

"It’s… Captain Elias Voss."

Captain Elias Voss had been the lead commander of the Prometheus mission. He should have been long dead.

"Captain, how… how are you alive?"

Static crackled through the line. Then: "Not… alive… trapped. We need help."

A cold shiver ran down Lena's spine. "Where are you?"

The signal stuttered, then cleared. Elias’s voice was low, urgent: "They found us. They… changed us. You can’t let them… find Earth."

Lena’s hands hovered over the controls. "Captain, who are they?"

No response.

Then the tone changed — a high-pitched, resonant sound that made Lena’s console flicker. Echo’s voice sharpened: "Lena, something is coming through the signal. I recommend terminating the connection."

But Lena couldn’t. "Captain, please. We can help you!"

Elias’s voice returned — hollow and strange. "No… you can’t. They know you’re listening now."

And then, the line went dead.

Echo’s voice was calm. "Signal lost. Tracing… unsuccessful."

Lena sat in silence, her hands trembling. The stars beyond the viewing port seemed colder, darker than before.

And then, a soft, rhythmic pulse began in her headset — a new signal, perfectly synchronized. Echo’s voice was quiet.

"Lena… it’s coming from inside the colony."

Lena stood slowly. Outside the window, a bright light flickered at the edge of the atmosphere. And then another. And another.

The stars were moving.
